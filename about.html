			<p>I am a passionate travel photographer and visual storyteller based in rural Bangladesh, specializing in drone photography that captures the breathtaking beauty of Bengal from above. Through my lens, I aim to document and celebrate the vibrant culture, rich traditions, and everyday life of the people across Bangladesh's villages. My work merges art and heritage, creating powerful narratives that resonate both locally and globally.

With several national and international photography awards to my name, I am committed to using my skills not just to amaze the eye but to preserve and share the soul of rural Bangladesh. Whether itâ€™s the golden fields of harvest, spirited local sports, or the architectural grandeur of our history, I strive to tell stories that evoke emotion, inspire curiosity, and foster cultural appreciation.
